Release v 4.4.0 (May 2017)
  - New major release.
  - Redefined API. Small changes to Standard API and completely new Expert API.
  - New deep learning based Face attribute recognition engine (age, gender, emotion, ancestry).
  - New image format shared by all Eyedea Recognition's libraries, directly castable to OpenCV's IplImage format.
  - Log to server and file now use JSON syntax.

Release v 3.12.0 (April 2015)
  - feature: New award winning face detector, achieves 2nd best on FDDB benchmark (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/results.html)
             Major improvement in detection accuracy in real-time face detector, now default in EyeFace SDK.
             (The configuration is not the same as in default real-time detector due to speed constraints. Contact us to receive the award winning config.ini)
  - update: Sentinel LDK 7.3 used for shared library protection. Enhanced envelope protection results 
            in strange behaviour (this is on purpose to make reverse engineering hard) of binaries in case that 
            license is not found. Always check stderr for problems with license when seeing segmentation faults.
            You can always check your license with example-getinfo or at http://localhost:1947.
  - bugfix: In expert-API, gender response was returned multiplied by 1.5 in comparison with standard-API.
  - bugfix: Remote logging syntax. "actionID" was by mistake sent as "actionid" or "actionId". This change breaks all 
    servers listening to EyeFace SDK that were expecting the variable with wrong capitalization. 
  - bugfix: Remote logging - start time in initial message was 0 instead of current time.
  - bugfix: Locale problem in logging / remote logging: The decimal point could be written/send as comma if the client code
            changed the locale to a language where the decimal point is represented as comma. Now only decimal point is send
            independently of the locale settings. 
  - API CHANGE: Log to text file - commas changed to ';' signs.
  - API CHANGE: Remote logging - Live track info - BB and angles values now separated by ; sign instead of comma.
  - BETA API CHANGE: Color detection now requires setup in config.ini, EyeFaceAdvanced.h
  - Security fix: Disabled SSLv3 in HTTPS remote logging, now using TLSv1 (using OpenSSL 1.0.1m, libcurl 7.41.0)

Release v 3.11.0 (November 2014)
  - API UPDATE: Added function efGetLibraryVersion, which returns integer corresponding to library version
  - API DEPRECATION: Deprecated API was removed from EyeFace SDK
  - API CHANGE: Detection models are now specified differently, see new config.ini and/or Developers Guide.
  - API CHANGE: EfGender enumeration values changed! GENDER_MALE and GENDER_UNKNOWN underlying values swapped.  
  - bugfix: detection on image borders, especially with rotations enabled

Release v 3.10.0 (October 2014)
  - bugfix - removed pthreadVC2.dll (and thus also EyeFace.dll) dependency on Microsoft's Visual Studio redistributable package on Microsoft Windows.
  - bugfix - tracking might fail while tracking multiple faces that appear and disappear shortly after each other
  - bugfix - person id not assigned in time limit (the id was assigned later so that the fix only affected visualisation in EfVisualData)
  - C# wrapper rewritten - new version of C# wrapper with unified naming conventions, and most of the functionality imported 
  - bugfix - face recognition subsystem - the performance was improved
  - bugfix - config.ini generator typo fixed 
  - Developers Guide - update on how to manage Sentinel LDK's Software key licenses by clients

Release v 3.9.0 (July 2014)
  - bugfix - Now it's possible to run EyeFace SDK without landmark detector (faster, but precision is decreased).
  - bugfix - Configuration file config.ini can now be located anywhere, in previous versions, it must have been in /eyefacesdk/ directory.
  - bugfix - Landmark positions correct when processing partial image region using BoundingBox passed to efMain().
  - bugfix - EyeFace GUI now works with Sentinel network keys.
  - bugfix - Incorrect world position estimation at video startup fixed.
  - feature - Added new function to detect Sentinel LDK key number used after EyeFace initialization.
  - feature - Added Java wrapper to make EyeFace SDK accessible to Java developers. Developers Guide updated with example project.
  - feature - New landmark detector with 19 feature points (previously 8).
  - modification - All wrappers (csharp, java, mex) were moved to \wrappers\ directory.
  - Expert SDK beta test - We release a beta version of color detector, further improving performance. You MUST read the details 
                           in EyeFaceAdvaced.h. The beta is only available to EyeFace Expert SDK users.

Release v 3.8.0 (February 2014)
  - New Documentation - Developer's Guide PDF
  - Improved landmark detection - higher precision landmarks, but slower (10% frame rate drop, you can disable precision landmarks in configuration file)
  - Library unified to a single package with dual API, accessible using license key type (Standard, Expert)
  - BUG FIX - rotations : face detector now allows for detection with in-plane rotation, see Developer's Guide
  - EfVisualData structure changed (added variable), rebuild with new header files
  - Updated Doxygen documentation
  - new version of remote logging library - enables https connection to log server

Release v 3.7.0 (October 2013)
- Coding conventions changed, see header files. 
  Old variable names are still usable (EXCEPT image manipulation functions), 
  but will be removed in future releases. You MUST rename the image 
  manipulation functions in your code.
- new Age recognition model, with 81% of age error < 10 years (previously 75% of age error < 10 years)
- New Face landmark detector library, "LandmarkRS", using min-convolutions method, 
  1.5 ms computation time per face compared to 5.6 ms per face in previous release,
  detection performance unchanged.
